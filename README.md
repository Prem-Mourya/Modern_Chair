I have created a modern chair using advance css and html. 
It gives me basic understanding of using advanced css and how to design a website from a scratch.
In this project you can able to change colour of chair using a radio buttons and changes appear on entire site . 
It basically a interactive website. 
I would like to thank Love Babbar for explaning this project so well so that i able to make it.
